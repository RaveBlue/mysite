            <h3>Design & Development</h3>
            <p>
              I first decided to learn to code when I came across this
              multimedia class, and we learned about different media careers. I
              came across web development and found it very interesting, so I
              switched from a degree in Physical therapy to a degree in web
              design and development. I then decided to join a coding bootcamp
              and I was able to join Fullstack Academy through Colorado State
              University.

            <h3>Coding skills and Education</h3>
            <p>
              Web design and development graduate with additional training from
              Fullstack Academy software engineering immersive bootcamp. I have
              skills using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, Node.js, Express.js,
              PostgreSQL, Git and Python. I also enjoy learning other languages
              such as French and Korean. I also like photography, and art as
              well as health and fitness.
